# Premium Volkswagen Challenge

This repository contains code submitted for a coding project. I was tasked to make a landing page for the new Volkswagen e-Golf. For this task I used HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript.

## GitHub pages issue

For some reason there is an issue with the info-nav fixing itself when it reaches the top of the users window. In GitHub pages it seems to fix before the info-nav has reached the top. I wasn't able to figure out why.

## Graphics and Design

The Premium Volkswagen logo was made by myself. Most other graphics was taken from the Volkswagen website.
